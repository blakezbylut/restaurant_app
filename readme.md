## Intro

We used Ruby On Rails to develop a full stack application that is designed to assist the restaurant staff in keeping track of their orders. The goal of the app is to assign orders to that particular server, make it clear when the order is complete is or outstanding, give a rundown total for the order through a receipt, and allow super-access for the admin user. The goal was also to host the web app on Heroku.
